# IOT-based-solar-panel-monitoring-system
This project monitors the real-time performance of a solar panel using IoT technology. An ESP32 microcontroller collects voltage, temperature, and sunlight data through sensors. The data is displayed on an LCD and sent to the ThingSpeak cloud for remote monitoring. The system helps detect faults early and improves solar panel efficiency.
